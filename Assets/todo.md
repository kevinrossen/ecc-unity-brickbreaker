Here’s what I’m seeing in your repo and scene, and how to improve the ScriptableObject (SO) setup. Results may be incomplete; you can browse more via GitHub code search: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Akevinrossen%2Fecc-unity-brickbreaker+ScriptableObject&type=code

What you have now
- ScriptableObject assets defined:
  - BrickData: sprites for health states, color, points, maxHealth, unbreakable, powerup spawn data, audio.
  - PowerupData: visuals, audio, points, type, and effect parameters.
  - GameSettings: controls, audio levels, difficulty, etc.
  - LevelConfiguration: level theme, speeds, target score, music, grid, availableBrickTypes, rules.
- Brick uses BrickData when assigned, but still carries legacy fields (states[], points, unbreakable) and falls back to them if BrickData is null.
- Your Test Level 1a scene still overrides legacy fields like states.Array.size and health on Brick prefab instances, which suggests most bricks aren’t yet wired to BrickData.

Recommendations to complete and harden the SO migration
1) Finish migrating Brick to use BrickData only
- Assign BrickData on your Brick prefab(s), then remove legacy overrides from scene instances.
- Mark legacy fields as obsolete and hide in the inspector to avoid future edits until you delete them:
  - [System.Obsolete("Use BrickData instead")] [SerializeField, HideInInspector] private Sprite[] states;
  - [System.Obsolete] [SerializeField, HideInInspector] private int points;
  - [System.Obsolete] [SerializeField, HideInInspector] private bool unbreakable;
- Strengthen Brick component:
  - Add [RequireComponent(typeof(SpriteRenderer), typeof(AudioSource))].
  - Use tags or layers instead of name == "Ball" in OnCollisionEnter2D.
  - Guard indexing: if healthStates.Length == 0, don’t set the sprite; if maxHealth > healthStates.Length, clamp or validate (see OnValidate suggestion below).
  - Consider moving color application to Awake/Start if BrickData is present (spriteRenderer.color = brickData.brickColor).
- Validation in BrickData to catch setup mistakes:
  - In BrickData.OnValidate(), ensure maxHealth >= 1; warn if healthStates.Length > 0 and maxHealth > healthStates.Length; optionally auto-set maxHealth = healthStates.Length if that’s your design.
- Scoring coupling:
  - Right now Brick calls GameManager.Instance.OnBrickHit. Consider an Event Channel ScriptableObject (e.g., ScoreEventChannel.Raise(points, position)) to decouple Brick from GameManager.

2) Level creation from LevelConfiguration (data-driven levels)
- Instead of placing bricks manually in scenes (as Test Level 1a currently does), create a LevelBuilder that:
  - Reads a layout (e.g., a 2D int array, or an enum grid, or a grid of BrickData references) from a LevelDefinition SO.
  - Instantiates Brick prefab instances at runtime, setting brick.brickData from the layout.
- Options for layout:
  - Keep LevelConfiguration but add a layout: int[] tiles or BrickData[] tiles with size gridSize.x * gridSize.y.
  - Or create a separate LevelDefinition SO used by a LevelLoader, while LevelConfiguration holds theme and rules.
- Benefits: smaller scenes, consistent behavior, faster iteration, and makes your SOs truly drive content.

3) Powerup architecture: move behavior to SOs and decouple spawn
- BrickData currently stores a powerupPrefab. Consider:
  - Store a PowerupData reference instead (data-only). Have a PowerupSpawner resolve the prefab for a given PowerupData (via Addressables, factory, or registry) and handle pooling/spawn.
  - Make powerup effects ScriptableObjects with behavior:
    - abstract class PowerupEffect : ScriptableObject { public abstract void Apply(GameContext ctx); public virtual void Remove(GameContext ctx) {} }
    - PowerupData references a PowerupEffect to execute on pickup/expire.
  - This keeps BrickData “what” not “how”, and reduces prefab dependencies baked into level bricks.

4) Use GameSettings in runtime systems
- I didn’t see GameSettings referenced by your controllers or GameManager in the fetched results.
- Inject or reference GameSettings in:
  - Ball controller: speed set from GameSettings.GetBallSpeedForDifficulty().
  - Paddle controller: use controls mapping and paddle speed from settings.
  - Audio manager: apply master/sfx/music volume.
- Consider a small RuntimeConfig singleton that holds references to your active GameSettings + LevelConfiguration to avoid sprinkling Resources.Load.

5) Asset organization and loading
- Organize SOs under Assets/Data/... and prefabs under Assets/Prefabs/...
- Consider Addressables for loading background sprites, music, and powerup prefabs referenced by SOs to avoid direct scene references and to improve memory management.

6) Editor quality-of-life
- Custom inspector for BrickData:
  - Preview all health state sprites.
  - Button: “Sync maxHealth to sprites” or “Pad sprites to maxHealth”.
- Migration utilities:
  - MenuItem to “Create BrickData from selected Brick prefab” that copies states, points, unbreakable, sounds into a new BrickData and assigns it on the prefab.
  - Scene fixer that finds Brick components with null brickData and assigns a default or logs a warning.
- Validation:
  - Use [ValidateInput]-style patterns or OnValidate to flag inconsistent setups in the inspector.

7) Performance and polish
- Pool powerups and bricks if you spawn/despawn frequently.
- Audio: instead of playing via each brick’s AudioSource, consider routing through an SFX manager that applies global SFX volume, or at least set audioSource.volume from GameSettings.sfxVolume on Awake.
- Unbreakable bricks: you can separate visuals from interaction by using a different PhysicsMaterial2D or layer, but your early return is fine; consider a subtle effect on hit to show feedback even when unbreakable.
- Consider a per-brick “on hit” particle prefab reference in BrickData to unify visuals.

8) Code hygiene
- Prefer [SerializeField] private over public fields on MonoBehaviours. For SOs, public fields are acceptable as they’re data containers, but you can still use [SerializeField] private with read-only properties for clarity.
- Replace magic names with tags/layers. Example: check collision.collider.CompareTag("Ball").

Concrete next steps
- Assign BrickData assets to your Brick prefab(s) and stop editing states/health on scene instances.
- Add BrickData.OnValidate and Brick [RequireComponent] and tag-based collision.
- Introduce a LevelBuilder that reads a LevelDefinition/LevelConfiguration grid to spawn bricks and assign BrickData.
- Refactor powerup spawning: Brick raises a “PowerupDropEvent” with a PowerupData reference; a PowerupSpawner listens and instantiates from a pool.
- Start using GameSettings in Ball/Paddle/GameManager.

- Draft a LevelBuilder + LevelDefinition ScriptableObject with a simple int-grid serialization?
- Create a BrickData custom inspector with validation and preview?
- Sketch a PowerupEffect SO pattern and a PowerupSpawner?
